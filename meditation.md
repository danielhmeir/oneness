I was sitting with my legs crossed, straight back, right hand in the left, eyes closed…

When I opened my eyes I was a young man approaching in a polite manner. He greeted me and said “Can you please describe what you are doing”.

I asked him to sit near me, cross his legs, the right leg inside, the left leg outside, straighten the back, put the right hand into the left. The right hand is the Beyond, the left hand is the world. Just as you are dressed in this body, so is the world the body of the Beyond, so is the right side folded into the left, among other reasons. It is a property of the mind to rationalize. Meditation leads to knowing through experience. Sitting with a straightened back reduces sleepiness. It is also possible to kneel or stand.

Then I asked him to put the tip of his tongue behind the upper teeth. Meditation expands the perception by reducing the unnecessary disturbances. Pointing the tongue up is to direct the mind up, among other reasons.

Then I asked him to close the eyes and look up at the light and then beyond the light.

Then I asked him to relax by breathing slowly out and relaxing the eyes.

Then I asked him to feel the warm or fresh air on his skin and remember that the Beyond dressed in the physical world is hugging him with love and care and, in a sense, would love to interact. With every inhale we can feel this care and love, with every exhale we can feel gratitude.  Do not proactively breathe, just observe it. Over time we dissolve into a union. 

After a while we come back. To finish, we should express gratitude. 

This practice also teaches us how to stay in touch with the Beyond until the next meditation.

This is the lowest form of Jewish External Meditation. External Meditation is when we interact with the Beyond in the external physical world. It is the lowest form of External Meditation because we interact through the breath. There are higher forms of External Meditation. Also there is Internal Meditation where we retrieve the focus deeper and deeper. But this lowest External Meditation is the simplest to start with and it is possible to retain it throughout the day. It is Jewish because we interact with the Beyond. It is possible that it is not unique to Judaism but this is what I practice.

The young man thanked me and said “I understand that assuming this position allows us to stay quiet and observe but doesn’t focusing on breathing narrow down the perception”

I said “You are right but focusing allows to calm down the mind”

“When we think that the world is the clothing of the Beyond, don’t we imagine something that not necessarily exists?”

“You are right but this directs us at the Beyond and creates a direct interaction, connection and unity with It through the soul which in its essence and depth is the Beyond. In Internal Meditation we retrieve the mind from all concepts but it requires more time and extreme intellectual depth.

If you do not assume that there is something beyond, you will never reach it. If you assume that there is something beyond, you can infinitely expand. If you think that it is just a psychological trick, it works in any case. If you don’t try, you will definitely not see a result. The fact that you’re asking demonstrates this quality of your mind. Meditation is a science because anyone can try it and, depending on your current state and on how you structure your life, you can progress step by step and discover the same layers of reality that many people before have done.

God bless you with good deeds, caring for others and Him.
