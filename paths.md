(Adapted from Hebrew for general use)

I am giving you tools to expand your perception of reality. 

We perceive the external world through the five senses. And, we perceive our body, emotions and mental activity. The number of these types of inputs and their ranges are limited.  And the mind that processes them is also limited in bandwidth and abilities. To extend our perception and processing, we build technological sensors and computers. But since the dawn of humanity, long before modern technology, people have been trying to go beyond the physical limitations. I am going to explain how. The information is not new but I am going to present it in a concise and practical way.

The question is why. For the same reasons why some people go into physics, neuroscience, psychology and other methods of expanding our understanding of reality and the mind. Some people research reality not through external sensors, computers and mental analysis of the data but through changing their physical body and mind thus expanding their perception.

Through special diet and training it is possible to expand the range of the senses. It is also possible to awaken dormant senses. But still they are filters over the real reality. What if we could drop the filters…

Another way to look at this is that everything that we know is external to us. Have we ever experienced ourselves? The question again is why. Well, if an actor forgets about his original self and starts thinking that the stage is the real world, we undoubtedly would think that he’s insane.

To guide you, I am using the language. Human languages do not have adequate structure and terminology to describe what I would like to describe. Subject-object, experience-experiencer, observed-observer are built into the languages. It makes sense to say that the observer is observing the observed. It makes less practical sense to say that the observer is observing itself, just as a mirror cannot reflect itself, or a source of light can only shine on something external to itself. Therefore I am going to be selective in terminology.

Our goals are to realize that anything that we experience is external to our innermost self, then through practice bring ourselves to the state where our innermost self has stepped out of any experience and just is. Some of you familiar with religions,  philosophies and mystical traditions may wonder what I mean by “self”, is there “self” at all etc. We’ll get back to this. For now I just need a word to use. I’ll use Self.

The question is why step out of all experience. Having been born on a small island, would you be curious what is beyond the horizon? Any experience attracts the self awareness of Self and may cause it to forget about itself.

There are 2 ways for Self to become free of the superficial disturbances and to become aware of itself. One is the way of withdrawal from everything, i.e. meditation. The other is the way of unity with the Ultimate Reality. The way of meditation is simple and scientific because it requires to withdraw the attachment to one’s body, feelings, thoughts etc. The way of unity requires one to accept the idea that there is Something beyond everything and to train oneself to be in a constant connection with It. This is the way of belief and religion. They lead to the same result. They should be practiced together. But most people have an inclination to one or another.

I will start with meditation because this method is simple to rationalize and it gives perceivable results as you progress.

Stir water and sand in a cup, put the cup on a table. This is you in meditation. The longer, the clearer the mind, the less affected You are by the disturbances, the more You see the distinction between what is superficial to You and the innermost You. 

To meditate, acquire an upright symmetrical position for a long time. Before acquiring a position, stretch slowly and thoroughly the spine, shoulders, hips, knees and ankles. Do not skip, do not overstretch. In this meditation, the bones should be in place and the body should be balanced because over time increasingly more "energy” will flow through the spine and from the spine to the other parts of the body, and any dam along the way will cause the “energy” to divert and may lead either to pain in that blockage, or overstimulation in and around the blockage or to stalling the whole process. I put the word energy in quotes because this term is not scientific. I do not expect you to treat it seriously. But if you progress along this meditation method, you should experience what I’ve just described. I will keep using the word energy describing what I experience. Biologically this may be just increased electricity in the spine. My descriptions are not about precise physics but about experience.

The ideal time for meditation is the morning after a good sleep, some stretching and a light healthy breakfast. How to sleep well and how to eat healthy is beyond the scope of this text. Otherwise, any time is good versus not meditating. If you really have no time to meditate, it is too early for you to meditate.

The best place for meditation is a quiet and safe place in nature. Otherwise, any safe place is good. If you really have no place to meditate, it is too early for you to meditate.

As you see, meditation has preconditions such as having time, access to a suitable place, access to healthy food, the skill of good sleep, consistency in keeping the body stretched and balanced. Meditation is a part of a path where it is not the first step.

I am going to list a few more preconditions.

Meditation is like water that feeds both flowers and weeds. As we detach from all experiences, the liberated energy increases them proportionately. Therefore in order not to stay trapped, we should retain only attitudes and reactions that reflect the nature of Self. The key ones are: non-attachment, selflessness, caring, non-egoism and gratitude. I will later explain why these and what they are.

But first, normalize your material and social life. A ship with holes can only sink. Have an income that allows you to have healthy food, healthy clothing, a place for healthy living with all the necessities, time and place for meditation. Establish peaceful relations with family, neighbors, colleagues and others. Your income should not be hurtful to other beings. Maximize your income without giving up health and peace of mind. Pay only for what you really need. Normalizing the material and social life will clear your mind and give you time.

The next step is to clear the view of your inner eye. The current configuration of your mind is a veil between your innermost observer and reality. With this goal you should develop the following states of mind.

Non-attachment

Anything that you perceive is like a wave in the ocean. It will pass and a new wave will arise. There is no phenomenon that actually affects your innermost Self. This does not mean however that you can neglect the needs of your body and of others. Genuinely caring is not the same as forgetting your Self.

Selflessness

Until now I have been describing your innermost observer. It exists but not as a self specific to you as a personality. I will call it Non-Self. It is tricky to understand using the mind. It is much simpler to be in the state where this is obvious, which is the result of this path. Once you stop relating everything to your “I”, you will still be able to cope with physical, financial and social challenges but you will see what really deserves the attention. Being in this state will eventually calm all the distractions over reality.

Helping

I used the word helping because it implies action for another being. Compassionate thoughts and feelings without action let you feel and show how good you are. Helping someone on the opposite side of the globe while you are not helping those who are closer also looks nice, doesn’t it.
Helping for the sake of the beings that you are helping leads to selflessness. Helping in order to develop selflessness is selfish. Helping out of selflessness is true selfless helping.
Help but think about the consequences for all parties. Non-Self expresses itself in our world through caring for all. Non-Self in you will not become self-aware unless outcomes of non-caring are fixed because it would contradict its caring nature.
Non-Self expresses itself in our world as a gushing spring of creativity that expresses itself differently on various levels: creative thoughts, love, energy of life. Any thought or feeling opposite to creativity, love and life is caused by a fixable misconfiguration of the nerve system or the body, except when we observe some external phenomena in other people. When we force ourselves into caring actions, we gradually reconfigure ourselves and enable the nerve system to channel the creativity of Non-Self.

Non-egoism

Ego is not who, it is why. When you act out of the caring nature of Non-Self, there is no why. While you have not fully returned to your Non-Self, acting through care will gradually liberate your inner Non-Self.

Gratitude

Realize that even when you attain results through effort, the results are not guaranteed. The ability to do the effort was preconditioned by long chains of factors out of your control.
When you realize that you are here not only through your choices, gratitude should open up in your heart.

How to meditate

As described above, prepare a place. Stretch well, especially the spine and legs but do not overstretch. One goal of stretching is to energize the body. Now let us activate the nerve system. Breathe slowly with the heart. When you breathe in, the heart opens and fills with all the help and kindness that you’ve ever received. When you breathe out, breathe out your gratitude. Although it is just a mental exercise, you do experience these feelings in the heart and your nerve system becomes activated in a positive way.
Now assume a symmetrical upright position. Specifics do not matter. Put the tip of the tongue above the upper teeth. Breathe out and relax. Do not get involved. There may be external distractions such as wind, smell, sound, movement or internal distractions such as breathing, pleasant feelings, thoughts. Ignore. Do not let your attention shift around but do not focus on anything particular. Relax the internal “muscle” of attention. 
The goal is to stay in this position without effort, ignoring everything, not focusing on anything. At first it will require physical effort, then internal effort. There will be numerous distractions. Discomfort, tension, external distractions, flood of thoughts. Just sit this all out. At some point the rising tide of disturbances will simply vanish. You will feel the quiet after a storm. Over time you will be able to sit relaxed, happy, with a clear mind, observing. 
A clear mind is a mind without thoughts. There are several types of thoughts: memories, thoughts triggered by the current experience, imagination. There is another type of thoughts: meta thoughts. They are a reflection of the inner Non-Self on the mind. They describe Non-Self to itself. When the mind is clear, there are also no meta thoughts. This to some extent disconnects the inner Non-Self from the machine it is sitting in. It is trippy and liberating and this can lead to 3 types of experiences that I will describe below.
You can also think of this as existing on a level above thoughts and mind.
Sitting in meditation is a position for going deeper and deeper but you can also practice this type of meditation when doing things that do not require immersion. For example, when you are working on a math paper, you likely need to be immersed in thoughts but when you walk in a safe place, you can meditate.

Enlightenment

When the mind is clear of thoughts, it feels as if light flows through the tip of the head down the spine, fills the body and lights it up from inside. It amplifies the existing abilities and activates the dormant ones. I am not going to list them because any experience is external to the inner observer and we should not be attracted by them. When this happens, just let it be.
The intensity of the flow can vary from gradually increasing all the way to a sudden burst giving the blissful experience of enlightenment.
This type of enlightenment can be achieved by a person who is physically healthy and energetic, who is calm and has no negative reactions and thoughts, who has self control. And although these traits require effort and the resulting experience is beyond what most people around can even imagine, it still does not indicate your wisdom and maturity as a person.

Out of body

I’ve been trying to stay within reason but some experiences are beyond the common experience.
Detachment of the inner Non-Self from the mind makes it possible for it to leave the body both voluntarily and involuntarily. There is no need for this. If this happens involuntarily, be calm, you’ll get back. 

New experiences

One by-product of the enlightenment is that you start seeing the light of happiness, friendliness and wisdom filling everything, the sounds form harmony, fragrance fills nature, and everything is in a friendly interaction with you. You start seeing the world and events as an interconnected web. 

The range of perception may increase. Just as a radio is tuned to receive a specific frequency, so we are tuned to perceive this world. Just as you can shift a radio up and down the frequency range, so we can shift and perceive a broader range of reality. The shift of perception can be horizontal, i.e. towards minds like ours but “hanging out” in adjacent worlds. Worlds are like rooms on the same floor with doors connecting them. This happens naturally in lucid dreams, like the one described in Alice in Wonderland. It is also possible to move down and up. Our mind can be dominated by the physical, social, emotional, logical, creative and spiritual levels. When the tuning of the perception goes below our world, it’s no fun. I am not going to describe this because I am already in the area of pseudoscience unless you experience what I am describing. But perception can also go up. When it goes up, you find yourself among beings more mature and wiser than us. There is a technique that I am not going to describe because even if you succeed, it is only because you were allowed. When you are ready, the technique will happen naturally. Later I will describe the structure of a human beyond the physical and this will help once you are ready. In any case, when the range of perception increases, just acknowledge and do not be lured.

Dormant senses and abilities may intensify and awake. Again, no need to list them because they are by-products and not the goal.


Experience is the distraction

Any experience is external to the innermost observer. Your interest in this topic, your desire to go deeper, your efforts, the new experiences are all just ripples on the surface that distract.

Selflessness

Any experience is external to the innermost observer. But the innermost observer is aware of itself only by observing its reflection in the reality external to itself. It cannot “look” at itself because whatever it sees will again be external to itself. The innermost observer can just be. Innermost you can be without perceiving anything outside of itself. When it steps down from this state, it no longer “perceives” oneself as individual “I” because when it just is, it is both featureless and infinite, and not different from the innermost observers of others.
This is popularly called ego death. 
This is called awakening.
You will also see that all experience is being generated by you.
In this state you not only understand the Non-Self of others, you also exist in unity with them, which leads to the deepest level of compassion.

Unity

When you realize through direct perception that everything is external to you and that you are one with all the others in their deepest point, and that all experience is a veil over you in everything, you will be in the state of Unity.
In the previous states you were in your body. Now you are in everything. Normally you should be able to feel multiple parts of your body at the same time and this is not unimaginable for you. So in the state of Unity there is no separation between you in your body and you in everything around. 
This is also the state of Infinity, or Unity with the Infinite, the Infinite One.
This changes your perception and abilities. This state is possible only if you passed through all the previous states, especially caring.

Love

Being in Unity is lonely because there is no one to interact with. There is no one to be grateful to for helping climb this mountain. No one to be caring for. You may think that loneliness is just a feeling external to your real self, just a ripple on the surface. You are right. But it is also a reflection, a projection of the state of the inner self. It is also a paradoxical state because in order to attain it, you must shed your individuality but now it is only you, you in everything but only you.
Therefore to retain humility, gratitude and care, we take a step back and now we are still one with the Infinite but also we can be with It. Now you know the Infinity and you are in a constant direct connection with it. At this point, your every action is dictated by your connection with the Infinite, your heart and mind are filled with humility, gratitude and care. The intensity may vary from quiet gratitude to a desire to swirl in a dance with the Infinite.
In this state you are never alone, you are always with the Infinite, you do everything together, you can always turn to It, bow to It, say You, say we, say thank You. Infinity in everything is no longer an abstract philosophical or religious concept but the most intimate connection. This intimacy is key to understanding the external path that I am going to describe later.
Also, in this state, the only possible way to view all beings is through compassion.

Home

After reaching the state of Love with the Infinite One, it feels like returning home. A peaceful and complete feeling that everything is in the past and already here, and there is no need to go anywhere. Everything is so simple. I wish I knew before leaving my beautiful island that after sailing around the globe I would return to it. But is it possible to experience this otherwise?
It is also the point where the internal path, the path of meditation during which we withdraw inward to return to our innermost point merges with the external path because we discover the Infinite One in everything.

External path

The external path is suitable for people who intuitively think that there is Something beyond our narrow perception of the physical world. 

Go out into nature. Smell its fragrance, hear its sounds, look around. All this beauty is a veil between you and the Beyond. But at the same time each smell, sound, ray of light is a tool of Beyond to interact with you. “Turn” towards Beyond, bow to It, say I know you are around, say I am asking to be with You, stay in this state of constant awareness in every place where you are, in every action that you do, and everything that you do will gradually align with humility, gratitude and caring.

As you see, it is similar to the major religions because we have the idea that there is Something beyond the physical and we turn to it in a kind of prayer. This approach can also be scientific if in the end we discover through direct experience what we thought to exist. Therefore you can use the terminology and methods of the religion of your heritage. The focus should be not on the ritual actions but on the direct connection to the Beyond.

This path requires the same prerequisites as the internal path regarding the body, income, simplicity of life, relations with people but instead of withdrawal as the practice for expanding the perception, this is a path of discovering the Beyond in the world around.

Although everything around is the Beyond interacting with you, do not interpret anything. The world is too complex. Over time connections among events will become evident by themselves but even then do not fall into thinking, just acknowledge your current flash of understanding and move on.

During a day, allocate times to interact with the Beyond. The best times are in the morning before you start the day, in the evening when you feel that it’s the time to wrap up, before starting a new activity and after ending it. The interaction is as I described above: mentally turn towards the Beyond, physically bow to It, express gratitude for at least one event, ask to be with It.

Constant or intermittent being with the Beyond calms the mind because it requires focus and presence. It also calms the hearts and fills it with light. You start seeing the world as radiant, alive and permeated by the Divine, including yourself.

This realization that there is no place empty of the Divine, including what you consider yourself leads to dissipation or a breakdown of the mental barrier of self and blissful merging with the Infinite. At this point you do not experience the Divine because you are One with It. Or, you experience Your interaction with Yourself through the garment of the world.

And then, as described above, comes loneliness and your previous self steps out of the Unity in order to be with the Divine.

This path is more suitable for everyday life because it does not require seclusion in order to meditate.

But both paths should be practiced together. The external path during the day, the meditative path before and after the daily activities.
