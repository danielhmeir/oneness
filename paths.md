About

This text is for those who would like to expand their perception of reality. 

It is also for those who seek to vanish before God in order to serve him with absolute dedication. This vanishing leads to the expansion of perception of reality including the perception of Torah and its commandments as they are beyond mental constructs.

The text is intentionally brief because when you do not practice, a text does not matter, when you do practice, a text is not needed.

Intro

We perceive the external world through the external senses. We also perceive aspects of our body internally. And, we perceive feelings and thoughts. 

This naturally leads to a few questions. Is it possible to perceive more of reality? Who is the innermost perceiver perceiving all this?

There are 2 ways to answer these questions. 

One is the way of detachment from all experience external to the innermost perceiver. The way of detachment is also known as meditation. At the ultimate point on this path, the innermost perceiver is fully detached from all experience external to itself and just is. Only at this point you really experience who you are. Before this point, you only have ideas about who you are. Ideas are not the same as direct experience. Without experiencing who you really are, you will never be complete and you will always be affected by phenomena external to your real being.

This way is suitable for everyone. It is simple to understand and it is scientific because it is based on observation and the results are proportionate to persistence.

Those who observe the Commandments will return to oneness with God. As you withdraw yourself from the perception, you let God in and at the same time you return to oneness with God. But if according to your beliefs this is impossible then don’t let reality deceive you.

The other way is the way of directing ourselves at what is beyond the perceived reality. This way is suitable for people who intuitively think that there is something beyond what we currently perceive. This is the way of devotion which is usually based on a culture of spiritual teaching dedicated to the ultimate reality, also known as God. At the end of this path, the seeker merges with the ultimate reality and finds out who he is, what the ultimate reality is and what the perceived reality is.

When you turn to God in a prayer or a blessing, when you observe a commandment for God, when you dedicate your actions to God or at least do them together, you vanish before God and thus discover the essence of reality and of your deepest “self”.

Both ways can and should be practiced together but each person will find one of them more natural.

I will briefly explain each of them, the final result, how to live with it and how to combine both ways.

Meditation / Detachment / Internal Path

Meditation is the way of detachment from all experience. At the point of detachment from all experience, the innermost perceiver is the only being that exists. At the very same time, the innermost perceiver becomes aware that it is not individual to you. The innermost perceiver becomes aware that it is in all reality, including in all people. This state may be called Oneness.

It also becomes obvious that all perceived reality has no existence of its own but is flowing from this One and that the reality is greater than as it was perceived before, although the discovery of greater reality starts to happen along the way before reaching the ultimate point.

The state of being your own essence is the state of being the source of creativity, love, light etc. for all reality, including all people and including your physical shell and thus being free. It is the most natural state, the peaceful state of being home free of all distractions. It is the state in which you’ve always been at your core and to which you’ve been always subconsciously trying to return by trying to find satisfaction in external transient phenomena.

Although in this state you do not need anything, this is a state of loneliness. Then you step out of Oneness. You are still united with the One but not by being in a state of oneness but being in a connection of love with the One. Then the only natural way to interact with reality is by giving, helping, caring etc.

At this point you also begin to understand the deeper layers of meaning of holy texts and the mechanism of the Commandments.

How to meditate

The best time for meditation is the morning after a good sleep, pleasant stretching and a light healthy breakfast.

Find a slot in your morning routine that works for you.

The best place for meditation is a quiet, safe and comfortable place in nature.

Before meditating, slowly stretch your spine and each joint of your legs in all directions until your muscles become warm and breathing intensifies, but do not overstretch.

You can kneel or sit with the back upright but relaxed. Put your hands in a comfortable relaxed position. Put the tip of your tongue above the upper teeth. Close your eyes. Relax your breathing, your tongue and your eyes. There are smells, sounds, breathing, thoughts but you are going to sit and not get involved in any of them. Any experience is just a ripple on the surface of your ocean. If you feel discomfort, relax deeper but do not ignore signals related to safety and health. 

Meditation is a cup of water mixed with sand. The longer it stays still, the clearer the water becomes. With time, you’ll be able to sit longer. The longer you sit still, relaxed, not involved in any experience, the clearer your perception will become but keep in mind that any experience is external to you, the innermost perceiver, no matter how blissful and divine it is. With time, stillness and detachment will bring you to detachment from everything, then loss of individuality, then unification with the Infinite One present in everything. This is the point of awakening and enlightenment.

Awakening and enlightenment are not the same. Awakening is who you are. In this case, you are the Infinite One. Enlightenment is what you perceive. It is impossible to describe briefly the fullness of experience from this point of view. If we look at the body as an example, the body lights up with the light of lightness and pleasure. If you are in nature, the air becomes filled with fragrance. The world around turns out to be in a loving harmony with you. And so on.

This state is also a state of being the creative, loving, enlightening source of reality and a state of love and care for all beings who can experience suffering.

This is a short description of meditation. To be efficient, the body, the nerve system, the mind require thorough preparation. I will return to this.

Below I describe the path of devotion that leads to Oneness with the Beyond beyond the veil of the physical world. Both practices compliment each other. While this meditation of withdrawal inward requires allocation of time away from the daily needs and goals, such as the study of Torah, taking care of the family, earning income etc., the practice of devotion can be performed throughout the day.

Devotion / External Path

This path is natural for those who have an intuitive idea that there is Someone beyond all perceivable reality. This idea emanates from the essence of a person. Whatever That is, It cannot be perceived because whatever can be perceived is just another veil on the face of Beyond. The only way to know Beyond is to realize experientially that you already are It covered by veils of temporary individuality.

One way to return to one’s essence is by withdrawal inward as described above. The path of devotion is by being with Beyond throughout the day in a most personal, respectful, humble, selfless and intimate way. Therefore instead of using the impersonal Beyond, I’ll use God.

This path is natural for those who observe the Commandments. It was described in the Guide for the Perplexed starting with 3:51.

Being with God, being humble and grateful, dedicating good actions and their outcomes to God over time leads to disappearance of selfishness and to a loving, happy, blissful union with God’s presence. What this union is is impossible to describe but it’s like being the source and permeating essence of everything. At the same time, being in union with God’s presence leaves no one to say “you” to. Therefore it is natural to step back out of this union in order to be again in a loving and devoted connection with God, but this time with the taste of experience of God’s presence. Being with God means that at every moment you are in the presence of God and you can say “we” or “you” to God.

If you crave God, you are building up your self separate from God, if you selflessly serve and love God, you are removing your separate self.

If you serve God but you are not respectful and caring towards beings around you for their sake, your qualities separate you from God. Good actions mentioned above are actions towards other beings for their sake.

How to practice being with God, what good actions are and much more has been laid out for us throughout ages by prophets and holy people. As you study, practice and peel off layers separating you from God, you approach understanding the essence of these topics.

In addition to being with God throughout the day, devotion can be practiced before and after meditation. After you acquire a position for meditation, breathe slowly and calmly with your heart. Breathe in love towards God, breathe out love and gratitude towards God. Over time this will lead to beautiful experiences, especially when you perform this in nature, just remember that your goal is love towards God and not the beautiful experiences. In nature this meditation of devotion has additional elements that will reveal themselves to you with practice.

Another practice is to stop and give space to God and just observe. The moment you step in, He will give space to you. A dance.

A deeper practice is to keep in mind that the moment you turn to God you assume that you exist…

It is also a good practice right before and after performing a Commandment, saying a blessing, praying, studying Torah as it reconnects us with God and allows us to act with happiness, gratitude and love.

And, it is good to do it throughout the day between activities or as a break.

Meditation of detachment is suitable for anyone whereas devotion is suitable for believers but devotion is more encompassing and beautiful. 

Psychedelics

Psychedelics shoot you towards Union but a trip depends on your skills in meditation of devotion. Like a strong wind, if you know how to use it, you can sail towards your destination. The effect of psychedelics is quick and temporary whereas meditation and devotion take time but their effect stays as long as you practice which can be most of the time.
I am mentioning psychedelics because they are becoming increasingly popular and available.

Prerequisites

Whatever is the outcome of Union is also its prerequisite because you will not be able to get into Union if you do not match the expression of its nature. We must unleash our nature of proactively acting for the benefit of other beings for their sake, be grateful for everything, accept that everything is for the ultimate best, be humble before God. This and much more has been laid out for us throughout ages by prophets and holy people.

Practicing only the path of meditation has pitfalls because it increases sensitivity and opens up dormant abilities. A person with selfish feelings and desires, with incomplete self control, with a silly mind will strengthen the selfish desires which will impede progress. 

Selfless, happy, grateful, loving observance of the Commandments and study of Torah structures the body, heart and mind in the most efficient way for the return of the innermost you to Union and being able to live a fully Divine life in the physical world. Optimized body, heart and mind allow us to experience all layers of reality, to tunnel, direct and ride tremendous amounts of energy, to open up dormant abilities. The study of Torah also causes us to think about important questions such as how to balance compassion and justice, how to go through hardships, what is genuine altruism etc.

Group

Meditating in a group creates resonance that helps all devoted participants go deeper/higher than when alone.

States of mind

In addition to these 2 paths leading back to Oneness, there is a practice of lucid dreaming that expands our understanding of reality. 

Out of body experience is another phenomenon that can happen during a meditation or sleep, if it happens, stay calm, you’ll get back. It can also be trained but there is no need.

Approaching Oneness is accompanied by increase in energy, sensitivity, dormant abilities and depth/level of understanding of reality.

There is so much to say about the layers of reality and tremendous energies therein that it is better just to practice. One thing worth mentioning is that accumulation of reproductive energy serves as a necessary fuel for the rise of the awareness up the levels of consciousness all the way into Oneness. While we are on the topic, sexual union between a man and a woman during her purity creates a tunnel for unification of all layers of creation and a tremendous wave of energy passing through them can take them up into Oneness. A single person can also serve as such a tunnel. Moving up the layers of reality and consciousness is also the experience of birth on each level.

Levels of mind

This information is not required for returning to Unity but it is helpful because once you know what subconsciously affects your worldview and choices, you will have more opportunities for liberation.
Each person has a natural affinity to one of the 5 broad spheres of life: physical, social, emotional, intellectual, spiritual. Each person has each of the 5 spheres but they are active to various degrees and one of them dominates. Each sphere functions on a scale between 2 extremes: altruism and egoism. The lowest level of mind is physical egoism where a person could own land, slaves, gold but in his qualities be opposite to Unity to attain which one’s nature needs to evolve into altruism towards all living beings and the Infinite. Combination of the strength of each sphere and its position between altruism and egoism defines a person. Knowing this you can understand people, how to interact with them, how they perceive you, how to liberate yourself from desires and thoughts that lead you away from Unity.
Groups of people are also dominated by one of these 5 levels and a position between altruism and egoism.
Now I am going to make a statement which is beyond the perception of most people. Each sphere has a point in the body from which it radiates. It is possible to experience this with minimal healthy nutrition, healthy and stretched spine, deep breathwork connected with emotions towards the Divine, relaxation of body and mind. The physical sphere is a fiery ball in the lower abdomen. The social sphere is a yellow shining from the solar plexus. Each 2 adjacent spheres overlap and interact. For example, interaction of the physical and social spheres strengthens the desire for procreation. The emotional sphere radiates from the center of the chest on the level of the heart. When a person is in a state of peace and compassion, free from social and physical worries, then the color is sky blue. A wise person radiates deep blue from the head. A person who looks at the world and sees beyond the physical radiates a range from indigo to violet depending on the depth of experience. White is the color of the light that enters the body through the top of the head and goes straight through the center of the body feeding all the spheres. Each sphere forms a layer around the central channel and goes into a sphere below it. So when the white light flows in the spiritual sphere the spiritual sphere has a white core and a violet layer around it. Then it descends into the intellectual sphere which has the white core, then a violet layer around it and then its own blue color. Light flows down from the top of the head all the way to the lower abdomen and then returns back. Each sphere opens up like a flower allowing its inner light to become the next sphere.
As you approach Unity, your perception of reality broadens and this information about the location of levels of mind in the body may help in multiple ways. One way is that you can combine breathing with opening the spheres upward as flowers for God with gratitude and thus increase circulation of light and move your mind upwards into Unity.

You and I are One!
