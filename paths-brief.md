Someone noticed that I regularly sit under a tree with closed eyes and he asked what I was doing. This is what I told him.

I do not let the external grab my attention. When I hear a sound, I simply hear it, I do not follow it with my attention or thought. And so with the other senses. After that I acknowledge my breathing, feelings and thoughts but do not follow them. At some point I disconnect from everything that I am capable of perceiving. I do not cease to perceive, I just cease to be captured by anything. At that point it somehow becomes obvious that I, this innermost I that used to perceive everything, is not an individual I but is the same in you and everyone and everything. It is impossible to describe it because it is beyond the basic human perception of reality. It also becomes obvious that it is the source of reality. It is also a state of absolute loneliness, peace and the feeling of having returned home. Nevertheless, to continue in the current body you must use it for connection with the Infinite One. Every gust of wind, everything is the Infinite One reaching out from His loneliness. This fills your heart with appreciation, gratitude, love, compassion. As these feelings are filling you, you step back to give space to the Infinite One. It’s a dance. You can be in this state throughout life. When you are in this state you also understand the state of mind of other beings and compassionate, helpful and respectful behavior becomes natural. 

Then he asked how he could start. I explained that Union with the Infinite One is impossible unless you are egoless.  Therefore behavior that is humble, grateful and directed at the benefit of others is the key.
As for meditation, it is just a matter of regularly sitting down for meditation. The rest will unfold naturally. But it is important to stretch the back thoroughly before and after each session. You do not have to believe in subtle energies circulating along the spine but by the time you start feeling them, the spine should better be healthy.

Then we talked about various related topics.

During meditation the spine should be straight. When you lie down, the vertebrae eventually sink down. When you stand or kneel, you cannot fully disconnect. Sitting cross legged is the most stable position. It also pushes the spine up.

Spiritual traditions describe the ultimate state of consciousness. In Judaism it is bittul - cancellation of self, in Islam it is fana’ - dissolution of self, in India it is mukti - liberation - and related terms depending on a specific tradition etc. Are they all the same? At the essence a human is the Infinite One. But the present awareness of most humans is immersed in the external stimuli. As you withdraw yourself from being distracted by experiences, you approach your essence and in parallel you may become overflowing with light and bliss and you may experience the rise of consciousness.
When your spine is healthy and stretched and straight, when you are relaxed and calm, you may begin to feel weightless and shining and blissful and much more. You may also begin to experience more of the reality including flow of energy along the spine. 
If you direct yourself toward the Infinite One, your level of consciousness may begin to rise during which your view of reality will come closer to the perspective of the Infinite One and you may experience the layers of reality above human.
So, there is disappearance of self, rising of consciousness and enlightenment.

Immersion in experiences is a cause of suffering. When you are detached, you see a bigger picture and can make better choices.

Is it better to follow a spiritual system or explore? A spiritual tradition offers you experience and wisdom of generations of spiritual masters. A few traditions have been transmitted and developed for thousands of years. But without being an explorer you won’t find much.

How to choose a spiritual tradition? Most people are born to parents who belong to a spiritual tradition or their parents did. Study it. See if it can make you more respectful, caring, appreciative towards all beings. See if it can expand your mind regarding the mind itself, the nature of reality and beyond in an experiential way. If not, there definitely are spiritual traditions that can. 
Beware of teachings that deify their founders.
Beware of teachings that allow special privileges to its more senior adherents.
Beware of teachings that promise rewards except for serving others.
Beware of teachings that encourage donations in exchange for benefits.
Beware of teachings that spread themselves by force.
Beware of teachings that are harmful for health, family, society, that allow harmful income, that do not encourage intellectual exploration.

Teachings focus on various levels of consciousness. There are teachings that focus on peace with the flow of life. There are teachings that focus on harmony with the energy of nature. There are teachings that teach about Infinity but require an intermediary such as a person who lived in the past or living presently or a spiritual force. There are teachings that teach submission before God. There are teachings that teach love towards God. But the deepest experience is the disappearance of a separate “I” and as the result living in peace and love with God being compassionate and helpful to all beings.
