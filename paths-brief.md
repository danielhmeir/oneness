Someone noticed that I regularly sit under a tree with closed eyes and he asked what I was doing. This is what I told him.

I do not let the external grab my attention. When I hear a sound, I simply hear it, I do not follow it with my attention or thought. And so with the other senses. After that I acknowledge my breathing, feelings and thoughts but do not follow them. At some point I disconnect from everything that I am capable of perceiving. I do not cease to perceive, I just cease to be captured by anything. At that point it somehow becomes obvious that I, this innermost I that used to perceive everything, is not an individual I but is the same in you and everyone and everything. It is impossible to describe it because it is beyond the basic human perception of reality. It also becomes obvious that it is the source of reality. It is also a state of absolute loneliness, peace and the feeling of having returned home. Nevertheless, to continue in the current body you must use it for connection with the Infinite One. Every gust of wind, everything is the Infinite One reaching out from His loneliness. This fills your heart with appreciation, gratitude, love, compassion. As these feelings are filling you, you step back to give space to the Infinite One. It’s a dance. You can be in this state throughout life. When you are in this state you also understand the state of mind of other beings and compassionate, helpful and respectful behavior becomes natural. 

Then he asked how he could start. I explained that Union with the Infinite One is impossible unless you are egoless.  Therefore behavior that is humble, grateful and directed at the benefit of others is the key.
As for meditation, it is just a matter of regularly sitting down for meditation. The rest will unfold naturally. But it is important to stretch the back thoroughly before and after each session. You do not have to believe in subtle energies circulating along the spine but by the time you start feeling them, the spine should better be healthy.

Then we talked about various related topics.

During meditation the spine should be straight. When you lie down, the vertebrae eventually sink down. When you stand or kneel, you cannot fully disconnect. Sitting cross legged is the most stable position. It also pushes the spine up.

Immersion in experiences is a cause of suffering. When you are detached, you see a bigger picture and can make better choices.
