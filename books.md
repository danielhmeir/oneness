# Books for expanding the perception

Recently someone asked me what to read about the expansion of perception and mind. I selected books following which one can change oneself because without changing oneself one cannot change the perception. Those who are not interested in direct perception should study physics. Actually, everyone should study physics. And neuroscince. Remember that reading and trying to understand will expand your mind but not your perception. Practice. The core of these practices is observation, either explicit, as in Indian texts, or subtler, as in Jewish texts, which is preceded by stretching the mind beyond what we can perceive and calculate, this, in turn, being preceded by wise and caring behavior.

I provided links to online translations where available and to printed books otherwise, nevetheless you can find all the books in print.

## Judaism

- Chapters [3.51-54](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_3.51.1?lang=bi) of [The Guide for the Perlexed](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed?tab=contents) by [Rambam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides). The original Arabic in Hebrew letters is [here](https://www.seforimonline.org/pdf/217%20%5bMoreh%20Nevuchim%20in%20Arabic%20%2C%20Moshe%20Ben%20Maimon%20%28Rambam%29%2C%20Jerusalem%2C%201930%2C%20%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94%20%D7%A0%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA%2C%20%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94%20%D7%91%D7%9F%20%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%9F%20%28%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%27%D7%9D%29%2C%20%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D%2C%20%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%A6%27%D7%90%5d.pdf) or [here](https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A0%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%9D_(%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A8)), and transcribed into Arabic letters is [here](http://sepehr.mohamadi.name/download/DelalatolHaerin.pdf)
- [Path of the Just](https://www.sefaria.org/Mesilat_Yesharim?tab=contents) by [R. Moshe Chayyim Luzzatto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Chaim_Luzzatto). The author lists the steps on a spiritual path.
- [Duties of the Hearts](https://www.sefaria.org/Duties_of_the_Heart?tab=contents) written in Arabic as [Kitabu 'l-Hidayati ila Faraidi '-Qulub](hidaya-ila-faraidi-lqulub.pdf) by [R. Bahya Ibn Paquda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahya_ibn_Paquda). The text in the PDF starts on page 8. The book is more heavyweight and has a greater focus on the mind.
- [Palm Tree of Devora](https://www.sefaria.org/Tomer_Devorah?tab=contents) by [R. Moshe Cordovero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_ben_Jacob_Cordovero) does not match the criteria of this page but it's my favorite.

I chose these books because they list the steps on the path of personal growth. Besides these books, a core idea of Judaism is to live a divine life by observing the commandments out of love and devotion to the One who commanded i.e. without a personal motive. So, observing the commandments and studying them is in itself a deep spiritual practice that broadens the perception if done properly.

## Sufism

- [Ar-Risala al-Qushayriyya fi Ilmi-t-Tasawwuf](https://www.amazon.com/Al-Qushayris-Epistle-Sufism-Qushayriyya-Al-Tasawwuf/dp/B08KH3T568/) (The Qushayriyyan Epistle on the Science of Sufism) written by [Al-Qushayri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qushayri). It is the first Sufi book that lists the steps of a Sufi path (in part 3 of the book). 

## Yoga

"To what is One, sages give many a title." (Rg Veda Samhita [1.164.46](https://vedicheritage.gov.in/samhitas/rigveda/shakala-samhita/rigveda-shakala-samhitas-mandal-01-sukta-164/)). Keep this in mind if multiple deities mentioned in the Indian texts trouble you. Focus on the core ideas and techniques.

- [Yoga Yajnavalkya](https://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Yajnavalkya-G-Mohan/dp/9810716486/). One of India's earliest and most influential texts on yoga practice step by step. It is more detailed in some areas than the more known Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. The Sanskrit text is in [this book](yoga-yajnavalkya.pdf).
- Yoga Sutras of [Patanjali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali). I find [this translation](https://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Swami-Satchidananda/dp/1938477073) usable and [this translation](https://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patañjali-Translation-Commentary/dp/0865477361) useful if you would like to read its main/standard/classical commanetary. They also contain the Sanscrit source.
- [Bhagavad Gita](https://www.amazon.com/Srimad-Bhagavad-Gita-Bhasya-Sankaracarya/dp/8178235072/). It describes various types of yoga and describes how to meditate. The linked book is with [Shankara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara)'s commentary. It is worth reading about Shankara and various schools of [Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta#Overview_of_the_main_schools_of_Vedanta) in order to be more objective about what you're reading. As the famous Dude said ["It's just your opinion, man"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95kNwZw8YY).
- [Yoga Upanishads](yoga-upanishads.pdf) are 20 texts describing Yoga and some of them describing how to do yoga, including meditation. Printed version is [here]([)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/8185141584).
- [Pratyabhijnahrdayam](pratyabhijnahrdayam.pdf), or The Essence of Self-Recognition, explains the essence of the Kashmiri Shaivism. It lists the steps leading to the final liberation.

## Theravada

- [Vishuddhimagga](https://www.amazon.com/Path-Purification-Visuddhimagga-Bhadantacariya-Buddhaghosa/dp/1928706002/) is the earliest text in Theravada Buddhims that describes how to meditate. A purely Pali edition is [here](https://www.amazon.com/Visuddhimagga-Path-Purification-Bhaddantacariya-Buddhaghosa/dp/1478369434/). This is the most detailed book on meditation on this page.

## Dao

The original Dao books do not list meditation techniques but they can help develop a mindset, especially ZhuangZi.
It is hard to recommend a translation. Due to the brevity of the Chinese text, all English translations that I've seen look clumsy. I'll give links to the site that is simply convenient.

- [Dao De Jing](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing)
- [ZhuangZi](https://ctext.org/zhuangzi)

## Kenjutsu & Zen

- [Miyamoto Musashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi) in [Dokkodo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dokkōdō) lists 21 principles that I find useful in preparation of the mind

## Lucid Dreaming

Lucid dreaming is an experience that although takes place in dreams shows us additional dimensions of our mind and our mental abilities. The oldest books that I know belong to the [Tibetan Dream Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_yoga) schools but books by [Stephen LaBerge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_LaBerge), a psychophysiologist specializing in the scientific study of lucid dreaming, are more scientific and easy for practice. They are listed in the linked wiki page. 

## Mindset

- [Meditations](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Meditations_of_the_Emperor_Marcus_Antoninus_-_Volume_1_-_Farquharson_1944.pdf) by [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius) will not teach you any meditation techniques but I find it useful for a mindset proper for deeper practice.
- [Becoming Supernatural](https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Supernatural-Common-People-Uncommon/dp/1401953115/) by Joe Dispanza is good for the mindset. Just keep in mind that when he uses scientific terms like _quantum_, he is just trying to sound credible but purely scientifically this is nonesense. Still the content is useful.

## Psychology

- [The Map of Consciousness](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1401959644?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) by David Hawkins explains the levels of human consciousness. It's a must for everyone.

## Transurfing

- Transurfing of Reality is a teaching by a Russian mystic Vadim Zeland. I really doubt that there is a readable trabnslation. 
But if you read in Russian, his bibliography is in Wikipedia. It is an interesting look at reality.

## Note

If you like one of the books and would like to follow it, it is wise to re-read it in the original language. 
Learning a language is doable if you allocate at least 20 minutes daily. 
I'd even say that if you think you won't be able to learn a language, you are not going to expand your perception beyond the current limitations.
